## WTM Algiers Official Website

1.  **Clone the project.**

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site’s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd WTM-Algiers-Website/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the project directory in your code editor of choice and add your component to `src/component`, you may test it in `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time! 
    
    * Make a special branch for each component, and commit only functionning phases. 
    * Never merge any branch without the team leader's review, just make a pull request and he/she will reach out to you asap.
